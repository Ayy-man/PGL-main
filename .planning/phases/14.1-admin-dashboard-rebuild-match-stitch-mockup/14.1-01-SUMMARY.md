# Phase 14.1 Plan 01: Admin Sidebar Nav Rebuild + User Card Footer Summary

Admin sidebar updated to match stitch mockup: two-section nav (Platform Control 3 items + System Config 4 stubs) separated by a divider, and styled Super Admin user card in the footer — replacing bare email text on both desktop and mobile.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Rebuild AdminNavLinks with two sections + System Config stubs | d81f6ba | src/app/admin/admin-nav-links.tsx |
| 2 | Update layout.tsx footer user card + AdminMobileSidebar props | 8f53eb3 | src/app/admin/layout.tsx, src/app/admin/admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx |

## What Was Built

**Task 1 — AdminNavLinks (committed in prior agent run at d81f6ba):**
- Renamed Platform Control items: Dashboard -> Command Center, Tenants -> Tenant Registry, Analytics -> Usage Metrics
- Dropped Users nav item (not in mockup)
- Added System Config section with 4 stub button items: Global API Keys, Master Data Schema, Security Policies, Integrations
- Stub items are `<button>` elements with `onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}`, `title="Coming soon"`, `cursor-default`, `opacity-60`
- Visual divider `borderTop: 1px solid var(--border-subtle)` separates the two sections
- New Lucide icons imported: Key, Database, Shield, Plug; Users icon removed

**Task 2 — Layout footer + Mobile sidebar:**
- `layout.tsx`: replaced bare `<p>{user.email}</p>` footer with styled user card containing gold avatar initials circle, "Super Admin" label, and email
- `layout.tsx`: updated `AdminMobileSidebar` call to pass `userName` and `userInitials` in addition to `userEmail`
- `admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx`: updated `AdminMobileSidebarProps` interface with `userName: string` and `userInitials: string`
- `admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx`: replaced bare email footer with identical styled user card (consistent with desktop)

## Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- AdminNavLinks renders two sections with divider — Platform Control (3 Link items) + System Config (4 button stubs)
- System Config items are `<button>` elements with `title="Coming soon"`, no navigation occurs
- Desktop sidebar footer: gold avatar initials circle + "Super Admin" label + email
- Mobile sidebar footer: same user card via prop pass-through
- No raw hex colors or Material Symbols icons used

## Deviations from Plan

**Note:** Task 1 (admin-nav-links.tsx rebuild) was already committed by a prior agent execution (commit d81f6ba `feat(14.1-03): rebuild ApiQuotaCard...` — the commit message was misleading but the file was already updated). This execution focused on Task 2 only.

No functional deviations — plan executed exactly as specified.
